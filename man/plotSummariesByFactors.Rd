\alias{plotSummariesByFactors}
\title{Plot aggregated summaries across factor combinations}
\usage{
plotSummariesByFactors(df, factor_cols, summary)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame. Source data containing grouping and measure columns.}

\item{factor_cols}{list of character vectors (possibly nested) where each element
is a character vector of length 1 or 2 naming grouping columns, e.g.
\code{list(c("day_of_week"), c("month","member_casual"))}.}

\item{summary}{named character vector mapping output column names to dplyr
summary expressions as strings, e.g. \code{c(avgDistance = "mean(distance_meters)", countRides = "n()")}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item plots: a tibble with columns \code{summary}, \code{factor_1}, \code{factor_2}, \code{factor_3}, and \code{plot} (ggplot objects)
\item combined: a patchwork object combining all plots arranged with \code{ncol = length(summary)}
}
}
\description{
Computes grouped summaries over provided factor combinations and renders
bar charts for each summary metric. Supports one or two grouping factors:
\itemize{
\item 1 factor: bar chart of summary vs. factor
\item 2 factors: dodged bar chart, fill mapped to the second factor
}
}
\details{
Uses tidy-eval helpers (\code{syms}) and \code{eval(parse(...))} to convert
provided strings to symbols/expressions for grouping and summarising.
For each factor combination and each summary metric, a \code{ggplot2} column
chart is created and combined with \code{patchwork::wrap_plots}.
}
\examples{
# summary metrics
summary <- c(
  avgDistance = "mean(distance_meters)",
  avgDuration = "mean(ride_duration)",
  countRides  = "n()"
)
# factor pairs
times <- c("day_of_week", "month")
factors <- c("member_casual")
factor_cols <- lapply(times, function(t) lapply(factors, function(f) c(t, f)))
# generate plots
graphItAll(df, factor_cols, summary)
}
